>>> SUPER BUGGER <<<
=====================

Objective:
----------
Are you up to the task?  Can you help our intrepid traveler evade 
the carnivorous insectoids while trying to make it to the water 
for a swim?  Or will you be just another snack for the insectoids 
insatiable appetite?

Bugs:
-----
The game starts easily enough.  It’s you against three insectoids.  
These insectoids can be on any row, at any of three speeds and 
coming from either left or right.  If you feel this is too easy 
you can always make it more challenging by increasing the number 
of insectoids.  To do so clicking on the following buttons;

    Easy     - Up to 3 Bugs.  It’s how the game starts.
    Medium   - Up to 6 Bugs.  A little more challenging.
    Hard     - Up to 9 Bugs.  Now we’re talking.
    Suicidal - Up to 18 Bugs.  Come on, I dare you.

Be warned, you may initially see less than the expected number of 
bugs.  That’s because one may be hiding under another as they 
travel across the row.  When they reach the end of the row they 
will separate and surprise you.

Every time the bugs get you lose a life.

Gems:
-----
You should never go to the beach without some money to spend on 
food and souvenirs.  Here money takes the form of blue gems, green 
gems and orange gems.  When you land on these gems you will earn 
points.

Scoring:
--------
    Go For A Swim – 100 points
    Orange Gem    –  75 points
